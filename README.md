This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# A Todolist App

For practice...

1. Clean Up the files for unnecessary codes
2. Add checkbox and tasks
3. Create component : TodoItem for checkbox and tasks
4. Create a list(data) with all tasks, status (and an id)
5. Instead of a number of <TodoItem>, map todosData to a list of <TodoItem> and output the list: {todosList}
6. Start working on checked property : test onChange
7. Write function to handle change in App.js because that's where the id can be accessed easily for which component to be changed and the status be toggled
