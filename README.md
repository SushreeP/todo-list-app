This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# A Todolist App

For practice...

1. Clean Up the files for unnecessary codes
2. Add checkbox and tasks
3. Create component : TodoItem for checkbox and tasks
4. Create a list(data) with all tasks, status (and an id)
5. Instead of a number of <TodoItem>, map todosData to a list of <TodoItem> and output the list: {todosList}
6. Start working on checked property : test onChange
7. Function to handle change is written in App.js because that's where the id can be accessed easily for which component to be changed and the status be toggled.
8. Create and bind a function through props to toggle the checkbox. Write the function body.
