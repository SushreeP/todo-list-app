# A Todolist App

For practice...

1. Clean Up the files for unnecessary codes
2. Add checkbox and tasks
3. Create component : TodoItem for checkbox and tasks
4. Create a list(data) with all tasks, status (and an id)
5. Instead of a number of <TodoItem>, map todosData to a list of <TodoItem> and output the list: {todosList}
6. Start working on checked property : test onChange
7. Function to handle change is written in App.js . Because TodoItem.js is just a frame to contain data, data is being stored in state in App.js so that is where it is manipulated.
8. Create and bind a function through props to toggle the checkbox. Write the function body.
